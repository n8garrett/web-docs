Syllabi should be stored in 2 locations:

- In the SOIC_syllabi share on store1 in the appropriate semester folder. This is for archival purposes. Either Word or PDF can be stored here.
- In the /syllabi/ directory on web1. This will display the syllabi on the website. The version uploaded here should be a PDF.

## Naming Convention

A specific naming convention has been designed for use on the web. For example:

INFO-I 101 taught by Nate Garrett: INFO-I101-Garrett.pdf

NEWM-N 485 Seminar in New Media (Topic: Web Design) taught by Nate Garrett: NEWM-N485-Garrett-Web_Design.pdf.

Using this naming convention will allow the course page to automatically recognize the syllabi for that course and display them correctly.
